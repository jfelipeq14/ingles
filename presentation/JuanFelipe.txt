Hello everyone, my name is Juan Felipe
and I am 22 years old.
I was born in the Leon XIII Clinic
in Medellin, Colombia,
and I currently live in the same city.
I am a student of analysis and software development at SENA.

I am a somewhat sedentary person,
but I like to play sports with my classmates.
I love soccer, volleyball and ultimate.

I am also passionate about teaching.
I am studying to teach technology and computer science.

My specialty in web development is backend,
but I have fullstack skills.
I have used HTML, CSS, TypeScript, C#, and SQL
with some frameworks and libraries,
like DevExtreme, TailwindCSS, Angular, dotnet, sql server,
and other plugins like PNPM.

In five years,
I see myself as a technology and computer science teacher.
I want to have well-developed skills to be the best teacher.

Thank you for your attention.

Bye, bye.
