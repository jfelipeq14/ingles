I don't believe anything Sebas says, because he's a man. But it seems like it's true that he studies the same thing as me, because he's in the same class.

You see how much of a liar he is, he says he takes advantage of his free time to learn and expand his knowledge, knowing that he spends it playing Valorant with Venezuelan-Peruvian-Colombians.

I didn't know you liked black, but it's evident from your skin color. What was the need to be black to show that you like black?
